# catering-system
Tech Elevator 1st mini capstone

Catering system built in Java while 4 weeks into Tech Elevator Bootcamp.
Involved creating a CLI, incorporating the 4 pillars of OOP, file writers and readers, and J-Unit testing.

The application interacted with the user via a console interface and had the ability to keep track of inventory, allow the user to add money to their account balance, select products to purchase, make change, and produce transaction logs.

Needs refactored and tested.
